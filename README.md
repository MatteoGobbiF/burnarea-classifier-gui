# Burned Area Classifier GUI

A user-friendly tool for detecting burned areas in satellite images using Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Designed for researchers, analysts, and GIS users, this application streamlines the process of image preprocessing, model training, classification, and validation with no coding required.

## 🔍 Overview

This tool allows users to:
- Train new SVM models on pre- and post-fire satellite images
- Apply existing models to classify post-fire imagery
- Test model performance using dNBR-based ground truth

Supports both **Sentinel-2** and **Landsat 8/9** imagery.

Built with:
- Python + Tkinter for GUI
- Rasterio, NumPy, Scikit-learn for backend
- PyInstaller for executable packaging

## 🧪 Example Workflows

- **Train Model**: Load pre- and post-fire images, mask clouds/water, define thresholds, and train an SVM.
- **Classify Image**: Load a trained `.pkl` model and classify a post-fire image.
- **Test Model**: Compare predictions against dNBR ground truth using validation metrics.

Case studies include:
- Alexandroupoli 2023 (training)
- Rhodes 2023 (classification and testing)
